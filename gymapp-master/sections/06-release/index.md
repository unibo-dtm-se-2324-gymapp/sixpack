# Release

- What to release, where, and how

## Choice of the license

- Which one and why

## Choice of the Versioning Schema
We decided to adopt the Semver (Semantic versioning) as versioning schema since is the most popular and accepted way to update software among professional developers.
Indeed, Semantic Versioning is used for its structured format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, which is became a sort of universal standard about the nature of changes with each release:
The 1st number stands for MAJOR variations,which can revolutionize the entire app and might require updates also in the OS or in the device used to make the application running.
the 2nd number are the MINOR variations, that introduce additional functionalities to the app.
PATCH version to fix small imperfections.
