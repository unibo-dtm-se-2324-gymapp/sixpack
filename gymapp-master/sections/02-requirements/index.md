# Requirements

- The requirements must explain what the application will have to do. You should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on what you want the application to do.

- Goals must be clearly explained

- Requirements are divided into:
    - **Functional**: describe the actual behaviour of the application
    - **Non-functional**: requirements that do not directly concern behavioural aspects, such as safety, performance, etc.
    - **Implementation**: constrain the entire phase of system realization, for instance by requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software tool.

- If there are unclear terms (ambiguous, very complex, etc.) these should be explained
- Each requirement must have its own acceptance criteria

<h3>Goals</h3>
The goal of Six-pack is to provide an easy-to-use app where users can manage autonomously their training routine by deciding which exercises to do according to their needs.

<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
<h5>User Authentication</h5>
Requirement: Users must be able to create a profile and log in to the application. Users can create this account with an email and password and then using them as credentials to log in.
<h5>Creation of a training session</h5>
Requirement: Users must be able to create a personalized training session and insert as many exercises as they want by simply pushing a few buttons.
<h5>Exercise customization</h5>
Requirement: Users must be able to decide how many reps and series they want to do for each exercise; other than the break between 1 series and the following one.
<h5>Image or video insertion</h5>
Requirement: Users can put a link to an image or a video so to remember how the exercise has to be performed in order to prevent injuries due to the wrong execution of it.

<h3>Non-functional requirements</h3>

<h5>Usability</h5>
Requirement: The application must be easy to use and an action can be done with a few clicks. Users can complete common tasks in a short time span.

<h5>Customization</h5>
Requirement: The application is thought for being as much adaptable as possible to the users' desires and needs with neither limits concerning the number of exercises they can do during a session nor concerning the reps or the series.
